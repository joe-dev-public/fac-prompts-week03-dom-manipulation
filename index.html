        Created as a response to https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/application/dom/

        Todo:
            - Make it look nice (including on mobile :).

        Notes:
            - Do we need a <form>? (What's best/most accessible practice?)
            -- You don't, but there are pros and cons to either approach. It's 2*3 of one and 12/2 of the other:
            --- Without <form>, there's less HTML, but you need to write JS to handle pressing enter/return with the input focused.
            --- With <form>, there's more HTML, but you need to write JS so that submitting it doesn't do anything (like "reload" the page).
