        Notes:
            - Do we need a <form>? (What's best/most accessible practice?)
            -- You don't, but there are pros and cons to either approach. It's 2*3 of one and 12/2 of the other:
            --- Without <form>, there's less HTML, but you need to write JS to handle pressing enter/return with the input focused.
            --- With <form>, there's more HTML, but you need to write JS so that submitting it doesn't do anything (like "reload" the page).

                Re progressive enhancement, it's not good to populate this markup using JS.
                But given this is an extremely simple demo that relies on JS to work *at all*, I think it's OK.
